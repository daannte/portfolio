        I'm a university student in Canada, graduating in December 2025. I enjoy exploring and tinkering with new technologies, especially when it comes to self-hosting, home lab setups, and building things from scratch.

        Outside of tech, I'm into football (the real kind), anime, and recently got into photography. I have an appreciation for minimalism in design, code, or how I approach daily life. I also like projects that blend creativity and problem solving, whether it's through a camera lens or a terminal.
